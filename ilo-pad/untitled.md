# ⚖️ Fair Launch Pad

Project developers who might be interested to launch their initial offering through our mechanism must be audited by our team and scammers and rug pull projects are rejected at revision process.

even if there will be a mistake or failure to the projects which are crowsaling via ILO Pad, investors are same for 3 reasons:

1. investors didn't invested their money in a project and all they have invested is their time which is also not acceptable by us.
2. Funds raised via ILO Pad will be locked in a contract and will be released phase by phase of the project development and in case of failure, the remained funds will be returned to the investors
3. Developers also are at safe zone as far as all details about the initial offerings and contracts and the way that they can get their funds are pre-negotiated according to their needs

POOLLOTTO and it's investors and token holders are also getting their fair benefits from each round of ILO as demands for $POLT increases and also there will be a part of funds which will be used to buy $POLT tokens and grants to developer in term of our native tokens.
